      Before this course, I was completely unaware of the impact that cryptography can have on our lives. The articles that we read truly helped me understand the importance of it. I think cryptography is positive as it pushes people to solve crucial mysteries and crack codes. Without it, humans like Elizabeth Friedman would not have had access to such top secret information.The whole process is very intriguing and alluring. After learning more about it, I have realized how tedious the process is. Misinterpreting one letter will throw everything off, making it impossible to solve. However, done correctly, it can lead to amazing findings. All in all, I believe that cryptography is compelling and is becoming essential especially as technology advances.
