      I thought that the Machine Learning we did in class today was extremely cool. It is amazing how technology has evolved so quickly and that it has the ability to give personal recommendations to people. Although the suggestions are based on patterns, I do not think that they are always accurate. If you looked at a pair of shoes with green straps, the machine would notice that pattern and probably show you something with similar features. In addition to not always being correct, the outcome is sometimes not fair. In the TedTalk that we watched, a womanâ€™s face was not able to be identified just because of her skin tone. I believe that Machine Learning is intriguing and impressive, but there is still a lot of work to be done. Technology is constantly growing, so I am confident that these devices will be even more successful and effective in the future.

      Before this course, I was completely unaware of the impact that cryptography can have on our lives. The articles that we read truly helped me understand the importance of it. I think cryptography is positive as it pushes people to solve crucial mysteries and crack codes. Without it, humans like Elizabeth Friedman would not have had access to such top secret information.The whole process is very intriguing and alluring. After learning more about it, I have realized how tedious the process is. Misinterpreting one letter will throw everything off, making it impossible to solve. However, done correctly, it can lead to amazing findings. All in all, I believe that cryptography is compelling and is becoming essential especially as technology advances.
