        My name is Maya Brody, and I am going to be a Sophomore in high school. I am from Connecticut, and live about an hour outside of New York City. I decided to take this course because I am interested in technology, as it has become a huge part of our everyday lives. More specifically, I find the creation of apps and the marketing with social media extremely compelling. Outside of school, I love to play sports and spend time with my family and friends. In adddition, I like watching TV (my favorite show is Grey's Anatomy). All in all, I am optimistic for this course and excited to learn more about the world of technology!
